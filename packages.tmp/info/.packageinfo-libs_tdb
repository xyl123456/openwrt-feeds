Title: Trivial Database
Maintainer: Dmitry V. Zimin <pfzim@mail.ru>
Source: tdb-1.0.6.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description:   TDB is a Trivial Database. In concept, it is very much like GDBM,
  and BSD's DB except that it allows multiple simultaneous writers
  and uses locking internally to keep writers from trampling on
  each other. TDB is also extremely small.
