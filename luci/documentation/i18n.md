# General
Translations are saved in the folder po/. You find the reference in po/templates/<package>.pot. The actual translation files can be found at po/<lang>/<package>.po .

In order to use the commands below you need to have the _gettext'' utilities (''msgcat'', ''msgfmt'', ''msgmerge_) installed on your system.

# Rebuild po files
If you want to rebuild the translations after you made changes to a package this is an easy way:

	
	./build/i18n-scan.pl applications/[package] > po/templates/[application].pot
	./build/i18n-update.pl po [application].po
	
*Note:* Some packages share translation files, in this case you need to scan through all their folders. The first command from above should then be:

	
	./build/i18n-scan.pl applications/[package-1] applications/[package-2] applications/[package-n] > po/templates/[application].pot
